Welcome to the Github pages site of the Redox Systems Biology research group of 
[Johann Rohwer](https://github.com/jmrohwer) and
[Ch√© Pillay](https://github.com/Chepillay).

The following pages are available on this site:

- [Signal parameter quantification](https://redoxsysbio.github.io)<br>
  A [JupyterLite](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/) instance for interactive modelling of signalling 
  parameters as described in the paper
  *"Characterisation of genetically encoded hydrogen peroxide sensor dynamics"* 
  by Lind, Rohwer, Veal and Pillay.<br>
  Once the environment has loaded, open the `Analyse_signalling.ipynb` 
  notebook by double-clicking on the file name in the left tab.
